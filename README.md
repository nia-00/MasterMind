# MasterMind

MasterMind is a code-breaking game traditionally played with two players. One player creates a secret code using multi-colored pegs. The other player then has a limited number of attempts to guess the code. If the codebreaker guesses a peg of the correct color in the wrong spot, the codemaker will let them know with a white peg. If they guess a peg of the correct color in the correct spot, the codemaker will let them know with a red peg. This continues until the code is guessed correctly, or until the codebreaker runs out of attempts.


## Requirements

Mastermind requires software capable of running a Java program such as an IDE.


## Usage

After downloading the MasterMind folder, compile and run the Java program. Once done, windows will pop up with the game and instructions to guide the user through the game.
